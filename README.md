# Third-party Partnerships and Integrations

This is a directory of third-party Kubecost integrations and partnerships along with relevant links and documentation.

We do our best to keep this list up to date. If you'd like to suggest any other Kubecost integrations, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kubecost/shared_invite/enQtNTA2MjQ1NDUyODE5LWFjYzIzNWE4MDkzMmUyZGU4NjkwMzMyMjIyM2E0NGNmYjExZjBiNjk1YzY5ZDI0ZTNhZDg4NjlkMGRkYzFlZTU) or in this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/kubecost/integrations/).

Equally, if you're a K8s tooling or services provider looking to offer Kubecost integrations to your customers, we'd love to hear from you too!

## 📄 Third-party Managed Services

### Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)

[Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/index.html) is a Prometheus-compatible monitoring service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications at scale. Integrating AMP with Kubecost follows a workflow that is similar to integrating Kubecost with any [Custom Prometheus](https://docs.kubecost.com/custom-prom.html).
